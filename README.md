# üí∞ React Treasure Hunt Game

As a developer, you are tasked with creating a treasure hunt game. The user will see a game board on the page and be able to select various squares on the board. Hidden behind one square is a treasure that will win the game and hidden behind another square is a bomb that will lose the game. All other squares will reveal a neutral image. The user will be given a particular number of clicks to find the treasure that will win the game.

### ü§î Remember

- Pseudo code!!
- Ask clarifying questions

### üìö User Stories

### Layout
- App.js: logic (container) maintain all the data, variables, functions to pass to other components.
- Square.js: display (presentational) - shows how to send the component back to the user interface.
- use console.log() or reference data to display on user interface.

- ‚úÖ As a user, I can see a page with a three by three grid board game with a question mark in each square.
  -branch: Board
  -known: 9 question marks and a square
  -return: 3x3 grid with question marks
  -process:
      - iterate across the values in an array and return a square
      using .map()
      -reference the value to make a question mark appear

      -added styling to center the grid
      ```css
         .grid {
          display: flex;
          flex-wrap: wrap;
          width: 620px;
          margin: 0 auto;
        }

      ```
- ‚úÖ As a user, when I click on one of the question marks an alert appears with the index position of that question mark in the array.
     - branch: index
     - known:
     - function: creates an alert message with id
     - pseudo code: input: index of the selected square, {selectedIndex} output: alert message name: handleClick
     - function call: onClick attribute on the specific square
       to prevent the function from being immediately invoked, use anonymous to allow the function to be called after clicking a square onClick={() => {props.handleClick(index)}}

- ‚úÖ As a user, when I click on one of the question marks instead of the alert the question mark turns into a tree emoji. 
     - branch: emoji
     - function: replace alert with emoji on {selectedIndex} for the onClick action
     - input: 
     - pseudo code: 
     - input: index of the selected square, {selectedIndex} 
     - output: onClick replace question mark with emoji name: handleClick
     - function call: onClick attribute on the specific square updating the value of an element in an array and setting the state of the board to reflect the change.



- As a user, if I select the winning square the question mark will become a treasure emoji and if I select the losing square the question mark will become a bomb emoji.
- As a user, I can click on a ‚ÄúPlay Again‚Äù button that will restart the game.
- As a user, I can see a counter that shows how many guesses I have left. The counter starts at five and decrements one every time I click on a square that is not the treasure nor the bomb.
- As a user, I can see a message informing me that I won the game if I select the square that contains the treasure.
- As a user, I can see a message informing me that I lost the game if I select the square that contains the bomb.
- As a user, I cannot continue to play the game after I win or lose.
- As a user, I can see a message informing me that I lost the game when I run out of turns (the counter reaches zero).

### üèî Stretch Goals

- Consider how to handle a situation where the bomb and the treasure are at the same index.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Developer Stretch Goals

- As a developer, I have a well commented application.
- As a developer, I have well written README file with instructions on how to access my repository.
- As a developer, my variables are all named semantically.
- As a developer, I have refactored and efficient code.
- As a developer, I have my application [deployed as a live website](https://render.com/docs/deploy-create-react-app).
